# Serendipitous-Recommender-System
In today's digital age, we are bombarded with information about things we should buy, what we should watch and where we should eat. The number of options we have for any given activity is so vast that analyzing each of them and making an informed decision becomes impossible. To overcome this problem, recommender systems are employed. These are algorithms that are used to sift through the vast amount of options available and come up with a few choices that appeals to the user. **
Recommender systems are used by e-commerce industry, content sharing and creating platforms like Pinterest, Spotify and Youtube, search engines and so on. Sometimes these systems are criticised for creating a “filter bubble”. Filter bubble is the potential of the recommender system to over personalize recommendations to isolate the user from diversity of viewpoints or content.
